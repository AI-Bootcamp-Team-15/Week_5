<h1>Final Project</h1>
<ul>
  <li>Procedurally generated DnD story</li>
  <li>Game master is made using ChatCompletions API</li>
  <li>Characters and People made using DAL E image generation</li>
</ul>
The idea is that this game's storyline is fully designed by your actions and what you choose to do meaning no 2 stories will be the same
